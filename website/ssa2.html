      <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, I created the spreadsheet that I had planned in Assignment 1. I used spreadsheet software to build and format the spreadsheet, added appropriate formulas and functions, and tested the final product to ensure it worked as required. I also evaluated how well the final spreadsheet met the original user requirements.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What I Did</h2>
      <p>
        I followed my design from Assignment 1 and created the spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel. I set up multiple worksheets and used a consistent layout and formatting style. I added data, headings, and labels to make the spreadsheet clear and easy to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used a range of formulas and functions, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>SUM</li>
        <li>AVERAGE</li>
        <li>IF statements</li>
        <li>LOOKUP functions</li>
        <li>Data validation (drop-down lists)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I also created charts to visually display key data where appropriate.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>
        I tested the spreadsheet to ensure that all calculations were correct and that formulas worked as expected. I tested edge cases (such as blank cells or unexpected inputs) to make sure the spreadsheet handled them properly. I also checked that charts displayed the correct data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        I evaluated the final spreadsheet against the original user requirements. The spreadsheet met all key requirements and was easy to use. The layout was clear and consistent, and all formulas produced the correct results. If I were to improve the spreadsheet further, I could add more automation features, use more advanced functions, and improve the visual style with additional formatting and conditional formatting.

      <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, I used Microsoft Access to create the relational database that I had planned in Assignment 1. I built the database structure, entered data, created forms and reports, and implemented queries to retrieve useful information. I also tested the database to ensure it worked correctly and met the user requirements.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What I Did</h2>
      <p>
        I started by creating a new database in Microsoft Access. I set up the required tables, carefully choosing appropriate data types and setting primary keys. I also defined relationships between the tables using one-to-many links where needed, ensuring referential integrity was enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then entered sample data into each table to allow me to test the database and demonstrate its functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created a range of queries to search, sort, and filter data. I also built custom forms to make data entry easier for users and designed professional-looking reports to present key information clearly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>
        I tested my database to make sure it worked as required. I checked that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tables stored data correctly and enforced data validation rules</li>
        <li>Relationships maintained data integrity</li>
        <li>Queries returned the correct results for a range of test scenarios</li>
        <li>Forms allowed data to be entered and updated easily</li>
        <li>Reports displayed accurate and useful information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I also tested for error handling and unusual input, such as blank fields and invalid data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        I evaluated my database against the original user requirements and concluded that it met all key goals. The database was easy to use, reliable, and produced correct outputs. If I were to improve it further, I could add more advanced features such as calculated fields, additional validation rules, and more complex queries and reports to meet advanced user needs.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Final database</h2>
